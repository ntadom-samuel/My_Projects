# Projects__s
This directory contains all the projects I completed under instructors' supervision. 

To be extremely clear, these projects are not my intellectual property. I created most of them by following the instructions I received when taking a course on Udemy or some other platform. 

Still, the following projects help to demonstrate my understanding of essential software and conceptsðŸ˜€ like:
a. JavaScript: The DOM tree, DOM manipulation, Event Loop, Event-Driven Programming, Promises, Asynchronous JavaScript, OOP, ES module, Common JS module, MVC architecture, Data Structures, etc.
b. Node.js || Express.js || MongoDB: streams, routes, middleware, Postman, MongoDB's aggregation pipeline, Mongoose schemas, schema methods, and query functions. 
c. React.js: components, props, state, JSX fragments, controlled elements, list rendering, e.t.c
